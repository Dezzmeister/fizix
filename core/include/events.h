// This file defines several events that are used throughout the program. Events
// are logically grouped into "event buses" based on their category. For example:
// a "render" event bus handles any events that have to do with drawing to the screen,
// an "input" event bus handles any events that have to do with user input, etc.
// Events can be anything, but so far it's most convenient for them to be small data
// classes. Some events can have "effects" that allow them to do something before and/or
// after they are fired. For example, the event that fires before every render pass has
// an effect that it uses to time the previous render pass. These "effectful" events are
// most useful if they're created once, outside of the scope from which they are fired.
//
// A note about input events: although an input can be made at any time, input events are
// only fired by "controllers" (see controllers.h) at the beginning of a frame. Events are
// synchronous, so input event handlers will only be called at the beginning of a frame,
// when the input event(s) is/are fired.
